I wrote in 250 words PDF: Client-server topologies define how clients and servers are interconnected within a network to facilitate efficient data sharing, resource management, and communication. Choosing an appropriate topology is crucial for optimizing network performance, scalability, and ease of maintenance. The primary client-server topologies are star, bus, and hierarchical, each suited to different organizational needs. **Star Topology:** In a star topology, all client machines connect directly to a central server or switch. The server acts as a hub, managing all communications between clients. This setup offers",

This setup offers several advantages, including easy troubleshooting, centralized control, and enhanced security since all data passes through the server. For example, in a corporate environment, a central database server connected to multiple client computers enables employees to access shared data seamlessly. If one client fails, it does not affect others, making this topology highly reliable. **Bus Topology:** In a bus topology, all clients are connected to a single communication line or bus, with the server typically functioning as one of the clients or along with other devices.

However, as the network grows, this topology can cause congestion and data collisions, reducing efficiency. **Hierarchical (Tree) Topology:** This topology combines elements of star and bus structures in a tree-like hierarchy, suitable for large organizations.

I wrote in 250 words PDF: Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a powerful communication mechanism that allows a program to invoke procedures or functions located on a remote server or system as if they were local calls. This abstraction simplifies distributed computing by hiding the complexities of network communication, enabling developers to focus on application logic rather than the underlying data transfer mechanisms. **Mechanism of RPC:** The process of RPC involves several steps: 1. **Client Request:** The client program calls a stub (a client-side proxy) that represents the rem",
